## Project Definition

**Introduction**

The aim of this project is to develop a cookie clicker game in the course / elective of Mobile Application Development which took place in CW14 - 2023. The game will have simple mechanics
where the player has to tap on the bunny to generate points and buy upgrades that will help them
generate bunnies faster. The project will be developed using Android Studio and will be optimized
for the Android platform only.

**Project Goal**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a fully functional cookie clicker game that can be
played on a virtual device emulator (Pixel 6 Pro API 33, Tiramisu), with engaging gameplay mechanics, visual appeal, and the ability to store userâ€™s progress upon closing the application.

**Project Timeline**

The project will be completed over the course of the semester. The deadline for the final solution is
set on June 18th, 2023, at 11:55PM. The final solution comprises of the following three items (to be
uploaded as a zip-file on Moodle).
1. The project description
2. The final app (as APK-file)
3. Presentation (slides as PDF-file)

**Features**

**Functionality:** The mobile app must be fully functional with a smooth user interface and user experience. The bunny clicker game should be easy to play, with the ability to generate bunnies and
purchase upgrade(s) without any bugs or errors.

**Visual Design:** The visual design of the mobile app is crucial for attracting users and keeping them
engaged with the game. The graphics and animations should be visually appealing and well-designed to enhance the user's overall experience.

**Database Connection:** An existing database connection is necessary for storing user data and
game progress. The database should be able to store and retrieve user information such as game
progress and in-game purchases. The data storage mechanism â€˜SharedPreferencesâ€™ will be used
for this mobile application due to the size and low complexity of data storage in this project.
